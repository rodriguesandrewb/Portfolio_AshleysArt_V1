				<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
				<p>When I was younger I knew I loved to paint, so I decided to do just this. Although simple, they are elegant and I’m hoping I can share with everyone and you will love them and they will inspire you. I love doing cartoony drawings and paintings that are very colorful. I’ve always drawn outside of the lines and I think you should too! Enjoy! If you want to get ahold of me, click the contact icon and it will bring you to a contact form so we can talk! You can also follow me and see other works of mine as well as see what I’m up to!</p>

					<h3>Inspiration</h3>
					<p>I've always loved picasso. Most painters stay within the lines, but unlike others picasso didn't. I know I'm not a michaelango, but I have a completely different and unique style that is only mine and can't be replicated. This is what makes.</p>
